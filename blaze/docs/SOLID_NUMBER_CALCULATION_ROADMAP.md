# Solid Number Calculation Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-01-23)
Solid numbers can be parsed, stored, and displayed with full notation including gaps, confidence, and terminal digits. However, NO actual calculation capability exists.

## What We Have ✅
- **Representation**: Full solid number structure in memory
- **Parsing**: Recognition of `!` (exact), `~` (quantum), and `...` (gap) notations  
- **Display**: Beautiful printing like `3.14159...(q:10^35|0.85)...787`
- **Storage**: Variables can hold solid numbers
- **Function stubs**: Arithmetic operations exist but just return left operand

## What We Need for Calculations ❌

### 1. Solid Number Arithmetic (Operating on existing solids)
- [ ] Gap propagation logic (max gap for add/sub, multiplied gaps for mul/div)
- [ ] Confidence calculation (how operations degrade confidence)
- [ ] Terminal digit quantum mechanics (superposition combinations)
- [ ] Known digit arithmetic with carry propagation into gaps
- [ ] Special cases: ∞-∞=ℕ, barrier type interactions

### 2. Solid Number Generation (Computing from scratch)
- [ ] Arbitrary precision arithmetic engine
- [ ] Digit generation algorithms:
  - [ ] π calculation (Machin, BBP, Chudnovsky)
  - [ ] e calculation (Taylor series)
  - [ ] √n calculation (Newton-Raphson with precision tracking)
  - [ ] Rational to solid conversion (1/3 → 0.333...3̄)
- [ ] Precision loss detection (when to start the gap)
- [ ] Confidence assignment based on:
  - Algorithm stability
  - Convergence rate
  - Numerical conditioning
- [ ] Terminal digit extraction from computation tail

### 3. Infrastructure Needed
```c
// Example of what's missing:
typedef struct {
    uint8_t* digits;      // Arbitrary length digit buffer
    uint64_t precision;   // Current precision in digits
    uint64_t gap_start;   // Where certainty ends
    double confidence;    // Algorithmic confidence
    uint8_t* terminals;   // Extracted quantum digits
} SolidComputation;

// Need functions like:
SolidNumber* compute_pi(uint64_t target_digits);
SolidNumber* compute_sqrt(SolidNumber* n);
void detect_precision_loss(SolidComputation* comp);
```

### 4. Mathematical Requirements
- Interval arithmetic for gap bounds
- Uncertainty propagation formulas
- Quantum superposition rules for terminal combinations
- Convergence analysis for confidence metrics

## Priority Order
1. **First**: Get basic arithmetic working (add two hardcoded solids)
2. **Second**: Implement gap and confidence propagation
3. **Third**: Add terminal digit mechanics
4. **Fourth**: Build arbitrary precision engine
5. **Finally**: Implement constant generators (π, e, etc.)

## Test Cases to Implement
```blaze
// Future capability goals:
var.d-pi-[calculate_pi(100)]  // Compute π to 100 digits
var.d-sum-[pi + e]            // Add two solid numbers
var.d-root-[sqrt(2.0)]        // Compute √2 as solid
print/ sum                     // Shows proper gap/confidence

// Should eventually output something like:
// 5.859874482...(q:10^98|0.97)...445
```

## Note for Future Implementation
When implementing, remember that solid numbers are meant to represent the reality of computational limits. The gap isn't a flaw—it's honest representation of where our knowledge ends and uncertainty begins.

The "big day" will be when we can type:
```blaze
var.d-pi-[π]  // And it actually computes it!
```
