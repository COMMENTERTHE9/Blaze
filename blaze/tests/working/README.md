# Blaze Examples - See The Power

These examples demonstrate why Blaze's unique syntax isn't just different - it's **better**.

## Running Examples

```bash
# Compile and run any example
../blaze example_name.blaze output
./output
```

## Examples Overview

### 01_no_boilerplate.blaze
**Zero ceremony programming** - Compare to C's mandatory headers, main(), return. Blaze gets straight to the point.

### 02_solid_numbers.blaze  
**Revolutionary number protection** - Solid numbers with computational barriers. Protect critical constants from corruption.

### 03_punctuation_syntax.blaze
**Every symbol has meaning** - Not random decoration. Each punctuation mark tells you exactly what's happening.

### 04_temporal_memory.blaze
**Time travel debugging** - Built-in temporal checkpoints and memory zones. Undo mistakes at runtime!

### 05_gggx_prediction.blaze
**Know before you go** - GGGX framework predicts if code will finish or hang. No more infinite loops in production.

### 06_direct_machine_code.blaze
**Faster than C** - Direct x86-64 compilation. No runtime, no libc, just pure machine code.

## The Blaze Advantage

1. **Less code, more meaning** - Every character does something
2. **Safety without overhead** - Solid numbers, GGGX zones
3. **Direct to metal** - No layers between you and the CPU
4. **Time is a dimension** - Temporal memory management
5. **Predictable performance** - Know complexity before runtime
